How it all works?

My task for myself was to build a "basic full stack application" for myself. To connect the frontend to the backend. ie when the user enters and submits information from the UI interface it will "posted" to the backend and the data stored on a DB.

How start the server:
Open the server folder, run the command "npm run devStart" - you will need nodemon to run this command

How to start the client side:
Open the client folder, run the command "npm start"

Bug at the moment. When I submit the information on the front end UI, my server side does not receive the object. If you open the console you will not see anything come up on the console,
but if you look under network tab you will see the the status 'pending' and it is just stuck there ;-( I cannot work out why it is not working on my laptop.
